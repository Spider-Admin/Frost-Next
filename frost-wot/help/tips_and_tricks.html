<h1>Tips and Tricks (Frost-Next)</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to Help Index</a></p>
<h2># Printing the Frost-Next help.</h2>
<p>The help is contained in "help/help.zip" in the Frost directory. Unzip it and open the pages in your web browser if you want to be able to print them.</p>
<h2># Read the list of changes in Frost-Next.</h2>
<p>The list of changes describes countless important features and improvements that are not mentioned <i>anywhere</i> else, and is well worth a read.</p>
<h2># Use the keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow.</h2>
<p>Spend some time reading the "Keyboard Shortcuts" page and memorizing the key commands. You will greatly speed up your workflow when dealing with messages and file transfers.</p>
<h2># Use the Universal Search feature!</h2>
<p>The Universal Search is extremely useful, and is a great complement to learning the keyboard shortcuts. For instance, what would you do if you wanted to start downloading a file named "cats-set250.rar" in a huge queue of hundreds of files? Would you read through the list until you find the file and then right-click it to use the menu to force-start it?</p>
<p>How about this instead: Click on any filename to activate the Filename column, and press <b>Ctrl + F</b> to begin a search in that column. Type "250" to find the file immediately. Press <b>Escape</b> to close the search box. Lastly, just press <b>Shift + S</b> to start the selected download immediately.</p>
<p>You should read the "Feature Details: Universal Search" page for more information about how the feature works and how to best take advantage of it.</p>
<h2># Seeing detailed file transfer information.</h2>
<p>You can hover over the filename of a transfer to see a tooltip with detailed information, such as the per-transfer speed, estimated completion time and other helpful information. This works for both downloads and uploads. Oh and be aware that the contents of the tooltip only refreshes when your mouse moves.</p>
<p>If you can't see any tooltip at all, you're probably in a multi-monitor setup and should try moving Frost to a different screen, since Java can be a bit finicky about tooltips whenever applications aren't on the primary screen.</p>
<h2># Healing other people's Freenet keys.</h2>
<p>To "heal" a file, you must insert the same file with the same insertion settings as the original uploader. This refreshes the metadata + file contents by putting it back into the network. But there are a few things you must know...</p>
<p>First of all, you will need the <i>exact</i> file that was used for the original insert. If it's a RAR file or other archive format, you <i>cannot</i> make your own archive since it will differ from the original. The <i>exact</i> file is necessary. Without that, you <i>cannot</i> heal the key.</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to know what insert settings to use. Check the Freesite or original message to see if the insert settings are mentioned. If they aren't mentioned, use the Freenet web GUI's "Key Utils &gt; Key Explorer" utility to analyze the old key to determine its compression and compatibility mode settings, but this only works if the old key's metadata can still be found.</p>
<p>If you can't find the old insert settings, and the old transfer won't even start, then your last remaining option is to brute-force the settings. To do that, you need to add the files to Frost-Next's upload queue, but <i>uncheck</i> the "Enabled" column before queueing the file (see the "Keyboard Shortcuts" page for a quick way of toggling the state and queueing the new files). Then right-click the queued "Waiting" file and choose "Pre-calculate CHKs for selected files". Wait a moment and then check the resulting key. If it doesn't match, delete the transfer and queue it again with other insert settings (try older compatibility modes, with and without compression). When you've got a match for the old key, it means that you've found the correct insert settings. Then just right-click the file(s) and choose "Enable selected uploads" so that the transfer will begin uploading.</p>
<p>If the original upload used a Crypto Key, and the key hasn't been publicly shared, there's no way for you to heal the file. That's why custom keys should <i>only</i> be used when it's <i>truly</i> necessary (read the "Feature Details: Crypto Keys" page for more information about when it's appropriate).</p>
<h2># Try exploring boards in non-threaded mode.</h2>
<p>Try disabling threaded mode, by clicking on the "Display conversations as threads" toolbar button (or pressing its <b>Shift + T</b> keyboard shortcut). In non-threaded mode, you will be able to see all messages chronologically regardless of their thread, and it is a great way to discover the latest discussions in each board. Furthermore, being in non-threaded mode allows you to manually sort messages by the various columns (such as Subject or From).</p>
<h2># Using the "Pre-calculate CHKs for selected files" feature.</h2>
<p>To be able to pre-calculate the key, the transfer can't yet have been started. Therefore, the best way to pre-calculate keys is to queue the files in a <i>disabled</i> state (by unchecking the "Enabled" column). This keeps the files perpetually in a "Waiting" state where they won't begin uploading, and allows you to easily pre-calculate the keys at your leisure. Then just re-enable the transfers when you want to begin the actual upload.</p>
<h2># Power users may want to queue everything in a disabled state.</h2>
<p>The "Preferences &gt; Uploads" and "Preferences &gt; Downloads" sections have options for "Automatically enable all new [download/upload] queue items". If these are disabled, your queued files will default to disabled (the "Enabled" column will be unchecked).</p>
<p>You're then able to easily queue hundreds or even thousands of files in a disabled state, which lets you cherry-pick a few at a time to enable manually. It gives you full control of <i>when</i> things will begin downloading, and can be very useful for power-users.</p>
<h2># Do not attach files to messages!</h2>
<p>Frost has the ability to use the "Attach" icon to add files directly to your message. However, this provides <i>zero</i> control over the upload settings and doesn't give you <i>any</i> progress-feedback whatsoever. Attaching files is <i>not</i> recommended to <i>anyone</i>.</p>
<p>Attachments are uploaded using the "Preferences &gt; Uploads &gt; Upload priority" (but the <i>message</i> itself is uploaded with "Preferences &gt; News (1) &gt; Message upload priority"), and the attachments are always uploaded <i>before</i> the message itself can be sent, which means that big attachments will <i>stall</i> your entire message sending queue until the attachments are complete. In fact, you'll stall the <i>entire board refresh</i> process, which means that you won't even see other people's new messages arriving in the board until your big message upload is complete.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the attachments always upload using COMPAT_CURRENT, no compression, auto/default crypto key, and the "Extra Inserts of Metadata" value from your preferences (and attachments are not affected by the "Quickheal Mode" toggle on the Uploads pane). These settings are the best for almost all files, but you <i>may</i> want to use crypto keys for extra security (see the Feature Details page for more information about Crypto Keys and when to use them).</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, it's <i>much</i> better to upload your files via the Uploads tab, where you have <i>full</i> control over insertion settings, won't stall the message sending queue, and can <i>see</i> the <i>exact</i> progress of your file transfer. When the uploads turn green and say "Finished" on the Uploads tab, just select them all and right-click them to copy the keys and then paste them into your message.</p>
<p>If you <i>insist</i> on attaching files directly to messages, then I suggest <i>only</i> doing it for small files so that your messages still upload somewhat quickly.</p>
<h2># Do not tell Freenet to compress your uploads!</h2>
<p>File upload compression in Freenet has been deprecated, since it is harmful and pointless. Freenet uses <i>twice</i> as much hard disk space and memory when transferring compressed files, and is <i>much</i> slower at uploading and downloading such files, as well as being harder to heal in the future. Freenet's developers have attempted to phase out compression for these reasons. You should only use compression for text-based file formats. Trying to compress archives, pictures, music or videos won't save any space and will just waste your time.</p>
<p>If you try to enable compression for a file, you will get a very stern warning and will have to confirm your choice and that you understand the risks. The warning will appear every time unless you uncheck the "Show this message again?" checkbox.</p>
<h2># Blocking unsigned/anonymous spam and abuse posts.</h2>
<p>The vast majority of unsigned ("Anonymous") posts are spam, trolling or abuse. A lot of long-time users recommend that you go into "Preferences &gt; News (2) &gt; Hide messages with trust states: None (unsigned/Anonymous)".</p>
<p>If you do this, you will not see their posts unless someone with an ID responds to them. This choice can save you a lot of sanity and means that you'll have to mark less posts as JUNK manually, but it's up to you.</p>
<h2># Marking messages as JUNK to clean up boards.</h2>
<p>Select one or more messages in either threaded or non-threaded mode, and press <b>J</b> to mark them as JUNK. They will be invisible next time you reload the board or change view-mode. You can press <b>Shift + J</b> twice to toggle JUNK display on/off to get them to disappear immediately. When toggling view-mode, it's best to select a non-JUNK message so that you don't lose your message list position due to the selected message vanishing after the view changes.</p>
<p>There is no harm in marking things as JUNK, and it won't affect the ratings of the people who wrote the messages, <i>unless</i> you also enable the "Preferences &gt; Junk &gt; Mark identity that sent JUNK as BAD (if their current trust state is NEUTRAL)" option. It does exactly what it suggests: If the author of the JUNK message is currently marked NEUTRAL, they'll be marked BAD automatically.</p>
<p>Feel free to mark <i>everything</i> spammy and uninteresting as JUNK to clear up your boards.</p>
<h2># Marking people as GOOD, BAD, FRIEND or NEUTRAL.</h2>
<p>The purpose of the trust state system is to help you decide your relation to that person. See the FAQ section called "What is the purpose of the Signature column for messages?" for more information about trust states, and look at the Keyboard Shortcuts page for ways to quickly mark people with the appropriate states.</p>
<h2># Using the upload log to remember what insert settings you used.</h2>
<p>If you want an automatically maintained list of all finished uploads and what insert settings were used, you should enable the "Preferences &gt; Uploads &gt; Log successful uploads to localdata/Frost-Uploads.log" option. It will log the key, insert settings and the time of completion. For more advanced, custom logging, you can use the ability to execute an external program on completion (see the "Feature Details: Execute Program on Completion" page for more details). You could of course also skip logging entirely, and simply right-click your uploads to manually copy the keys or extended information as usual.</p>
<h2># Faster message searches by only searching specific boards.</h2>
<p>You can <i>greatly</i> speed up searches if you know what board the desired message comes from. Right-click on the board and choose "Search this board", or select one or more boards manually via the "Boards" tab of the search window. This avoids having to search through thousands of unrelated messages.</p>
<h2># Finding all messages from a certain person.</h2>
<p>To find all posts by a certain person, open the message search window and type "their name@" in the Sender field. The trailing "@" symbol just helps avoid false positives, since it's the name separator symbol.</p>
<h2># Retrieving today's messages while you're busy with an "all days" scan.</h2>
<p>If you've ever started a massive "all days backwards" message retrieval, you know that it can take a <i>very</i> long time. It's now possible to retrieve today's latest messages even while Frost-Next is busy with a long, slow "all days" scan. Just right-click on the busy board and choose "Refresh board". This starts a quick "today"-scan <i>in parallel</i> with the ongoing "all days" scan, without interrupting your progress. It will even upload any outgoing messages you may have.</p>
<h2># Performing an "all days" scan from a specific start day in the past.</h2>
<p>You can right-click on a board and choose "Configure selected board". From there, enable "Override default settings" and set a value in the "Days backwards to start downloading from" field. The number "1" means today, "2" means yesterday, and so on, up until the maximum number of days to download. If the start-day isn't configured, it always starts from 1 (today). By configuring the option, you can skip all recent dates and start far back in time instead. You can for example set a board to start from day "300" and download until day "1200", which will save you a lot of time if you know that you've already got all messages from days 1-300.</p>
<h2># Stopping and resuming an "all days" scan.</h2>
<p>You can right-click on a board and select "Stop refresh". This tells the board to stop after it's done grabbing the message(s) it's currently working on, which means that the board refresh usually stops within 10-40 seconds.</p>
<p>Stopping an "all days" refresh means that you can then right-click and choose "Resume refresh" to resume from the day you interrupted. The menu item <i>only</i> shows up if the board's <i>last</i> refresh was an <i>unfinished</i> "All days back" scan.</p>
<p>Note that if you stop a board update and then resume it a few days later (which is possible as long as <i>no</i> other board refreshes ran for that board in the meantime), then Frost-Next will adjust the start/max days to compensate so that it starts at the <i>exact</i> date you left off at. So even though you might have set everything to download 30 days (for example), the status bar indicator could say something like "Downloading Day 11/40 (2015-11-16)" when you resume instead. Don't worry; it always downloads <i>exactly</i> as many days as you asked for, but it compensates for the time elapsed since you interrupted the board update.</p>
<h2># Forcing an "all days" scan to take place ahead of schedule.</h2>
<p>By default, the "all days" scan only happens every 12 hours. At any other time, your board refresh will only download the messages for "today". But you can enable "Preferences &gt; News (1) &gt; Always download all days backwards" if you want to force a board to do its "all days" scan even if it isn't time yet.</p>
<p>A common technique is to set up your desired "Number of days to download backwards", disable "Automatic board update", enable "Always download all days backwards", and close the preferences. Then right-click all the appropriate boards and choose "Refresh boards" to force their "all days" scans to begin. Next, go back into the preferences and re-enable "Automatic board update" and disable "Always download all days backwards". The scans you started will keep running, but the application will behave normally for any further refreshes that begin.</p>
<h2># Downloading all file keys from a message.</h2>
<p>There are two ways to download all keys from a message. The first method is to press your operating system's "select all text" shortcut (usually <b>Ctrl + A</b>) and then right-clicking <i>anywhere</i> in the white message area and choosing "Download selected keys". The second method is to <i>left-click</i> on a blue-highlighted key link in the message (if "Show clickable Freenet keys in messages" is enabled, which it is by default), and then choosing "Download all file keys". The key link menu also has other options that are worth exploring.</p>
<h2># Downloading a few file keys from a message.</h2>
<p>Drag a selection over a few lines of keys (be sure to select the entire key), and then right-click anywhere in the white message area and choose "Download selected keys" to get <i>just</i> those keys.</p>
<h2># Understanding the different menu choices when clicking on keys.</h2>
<p>If you click on any file link in a message, many of the options come in two versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"X from current message" means that it only uses the keys that come <i>after</i> the ID-line of the current message. The "ID-line" is the "----- NAME ----- DATE -----" line, which is highlighted with a gray background. This is often a useful choice since it lets you act on the <i>latest</i> keys in very long threads.</li>
  <li>"X all" means all keys from the message <i>including</i> everything <i>above</i> the ID-line too. In other words, it looks at <i>everything</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h2># Quickly saving downloads to previously used folders.</h2>
<p>Simply right-click on the files in the "Add new downloads" window and choose the directory from the "Set download dir to..." sub-menu. It contains the 20 most recently used directories, with the most recent at the top of the list.</p>
<h2># Jumping back to the original message your downloads came from.</h2>
<p>If you've queued a few keys from a board message, you can actually right-click those files in the Downloads table and simply choose "View associated message" to jump directly to it, as long as the message is still visible in the current view-mode.</p>
<h2># Automatically sorting downloads into folders by board name.</h2>
<p>If you do a lot of file downloads from board messages, you may be happy to know that you can <i>automatically</i> save them to folders named after the board they came from, such as "downloads/example board". Simply enable "Preferences &gt; Downloads &gt; Save files into subfolders named after the boards they came from".</p>
<h2># Pasting multiple sets of keys into the download dialog.</h2>
<p>If you've used the "Download keys from clipboard" button (on the "Downloads" tab), the resulting "Add new downloads" window will have a button that says "Paste more keys from clipboard". Press the button (or use its <b>V</b> keyboard shortcut) to check the clipboard content for <i>more</i> keys. This allows you to easily copy and paste multiple chunks of keys into Frost and to queue them all simultaneously.</p>
<h2># Filtering upload file types.</h2>
<p>There is a "Filter" dropdown in the file selection window, which allows you to decide what types of files you want to see. For instance, you could choose "Archives" to only see various archive formats. This allows you to quickly find and queue the exact files you need.</p>
<h2># Renaming uploads without needing to rename your on-disk files.</h2>
<p>Before you finish queueing your new uploads, you can right-click them in the "Add new uploads" window and then choose "Rename". This allows you to give them a new name that doesn't have to be the same as your on-disk filename. It will not change your on-disk filenames, but it <i>will</i> change the name used in the resulting key, and it's therefore an easy way to name your uploads to comply with some naming standard.</p>
<h2># Deleting temporary upload files after queueing.</h2>
<p>Some people like to put their uploads in a temporary folder and queue them from there. With Frost-Next, you can actually <i>delete</i> your temporary files as soon as your Freenet node has started uploading them. Just queue the files, start them <i>all</i> (easiest done by selecting them all and choosing "Start selected uploads immediately" from the right-click menu), and then <i>wait</i> for a little bit until you see their block counters (which will say "0/X" to begin with, such as "0/1230"). The count comes from the node, and the ability to see a block-count means that the files have been fully sent into the Freenet node and are handled by it now, and you're then safely able to delete the temporary on-disk files if you don't want them anymore.</p>
<h2># Measuring the transfer speed of your node.</h2>
<p>If you want to see the speed of your current uploads and downloads, just look at the "BPM" counter in the top-right corner of the Downloads or Uploads panels. It measures the combined Blocks Per Minute (BPM) speed of all transfers on that particular tab; so the Downloads tab shows download-speed, and the Uploads tab shows upload-speed. If you have any ongoing external transfers (not queued in Frost), then you should also enable "Show global queue" to include those in the count. Read the "Changes: File Transfers" page if you want more details about how Frost-Next's blocks per minute counter is operating.</p>
<h2># Having a temporary pause in your download queue.</h2>
<p>The "Pause" and "Play" buttons at the top left of the Downloads tab can be very useful. If you pause downloading, it means that Frost will not start any of the "Waiting" downloads. Any currently ongoing downloads will still continue as usual, of course.</p>
<h2># How to cancel ongoing file transfers without removing them.</h2>
<p>It is actually possible to cancel ongoing uploads or downloads without deleting them from your queue. Just right-click and choose "Remove from global queue". This aborts the transfers and marks them as Failed. Later, you can simply right-click those transfers and choose the option to restart them.</p>
<h2># Saving externally queued downloads to disk.</h2>
<p>You can actually write files to disk even if they weren't queued by Frost itself. If you right-click on a Finished "Show global queue" item, you can choose "Retrieve selected global downloads into download directory" to save them into "downloads/" even if they didn't originate from your Frost instance.</p>
<h2># Sorting downloads into related "groups" of files.</h2>
<p>If you remember to always assign the same download folder to all related files, you'll be able to quickly sort your download queue by the "Download Directory" column to see all related files. I suggest making folders for the type or subject matter of each group of related downloads, such as "downloads/cat pictures" and "downloads/dog videos". This acts like a "group" or "note/comment", which describes how the files are related, and it has the benefit of being a folder on your filesystem which means that you don't have to waste time manually sorting the downloads when they're done.</p>
<h2># Changing the user interface fonts and colors.</h2>
<p>If you go into "Preferences &gt; Display", you can configure the fonts and colors for the GUI, as well as things like the message tree expansion icons. Have a look around! These settings are very useful for people with "retina" monitors where the text is otherwise too tiny.</p>
<h2># Try the different types of threaded mode!</h2>
<p>Did you know that there's more than one type of threading? The "Preferences &gt; Messages" settings has a few interesting options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Sort message thread root messages ascending (oldest topmost)" puts the oldest threads at the top.</li>
  <li>"Show collapsed message threads (default is expanded)" will make all threads collapsed so that you have to click them manually to see their replies.</li>
  <li>(Sub-option) "Pre-expand all replies" ensures that the whole thread will be visible when you expand the topmost parent. Without this option, you'll have to manually open each level of replies.</li>
  <li>(Sub-option) "Expand unread messages" will pre-expand any threads that have unread messages. This is a very good mode for people who like threaded mode but have read most messages already. It still allows the "collapse" option to minimize the size of threads you've already read, but expands all unread material so that it's at the forefront.</li>
</ul>
<h2># Grouping boards into folders.</h2>
<p>You can press the "New folder" button in the "News" tab toolbar to create a new board folder, where you can drag and drop one or more boards. Having a folder allows you to right-click it and choose "Configure selected folder", to apply board overrides to every board in that folder (but their own overrides still take precedence, if configured). This allows you to make groups of boards that update less frequently, or where you want to hide all anonymous posts, and so on.</p>
<p>You can even right-click the folder and choose "Refresh folder" to refresh every board in that folder. However, there's a better way to "refresh all boards" if that's what you want to achieve: Simply click the "question mark speech bubble" icon in the "News" tab toolbar to open the "Board Information" window. From there, click on "Update all boards".</p>
<h2># Quickly checking all preview images from a message.</h2>
<p>If you click on any file link in a message, you can choose "Open all image keys in browser" to instantly open all <i>image links</i> for previewing in the browser. This is a very useful feature since it lets you check what the post contains before deciding to download it. There's also "Open all image keys from current message in browser" which only opens the image keys that come <i>after</i> the ID-line of the current message.</p>
<h2># You might need a better web browser.</h2>
<p>If your computer sometimes freezes a bit when you use the "Open all image keys in browser" feature, it's because of bugs in your web browser (for instance, Firefox has that bug). We only open 2 tabs per second, but some browsers might freak out and take a while to process that. In that case, just wait and it will get unstuck as soon as the browser wakes up again.</p>
<h2># Saving disk space by de-queueing finished downloads.</h2>
<p>If you check the "Remove finished" checkbox on your Downloads panel, you will free up disk space in your Freenet node by clearing them out of the node's temp folder. Otherwise, the finished files will exist in both your Freenet temp folder <i>and</i> in the final file in your Frost download directory.</p>
<h2># Preserving your message selection when switching a board's view-mode.</h2>
<p>Switching your view-mode must be done in a certain order if you want to preserve your current message selection, because each time you change the view-mode it causes a board reload, and any messages that don't fit into the new rules will be hidden. If your currently selected message isn't visible in the new view-mode, you will <i>lose</i> your message selection. For example, if you mark a message as JUNK and then disable the display of JUNK messages, you'll <i>obviously</i> lose that message selection. So before switching view-modes, you should <i>always</i> select a message that will be visible in the new mode, if you care about preserving the old message selection.</p>
<h2># Do not download large files via your web browser.</h2>
<p>Frost-Next uses bulk CHK transfer mode for privacy. Realtime mode (downloading whole files via a browser tab) is very bad for privacy. There is less realtime traffic than bulk traffic on the network, so it's easier to trace. If you <i>really</i> want to download <i>something</i> in realtime mode, just queue it in Frost and then open the same link in a web browser tab <i>too</i>. The blocks that come in through the browser (realtime) request will also update the regular-queue request. However, this is very dangerous for large files due to the risks involved with realtime mode, and I suggest that you <i>never</i> do it for anything larger than 10 MiB.</p>
<h2># Why posting as "Anonymous" is not more anonymous.</h2>
<p>Messages take a random path through the network every time you insert them; the destination crypto key that the message is uploaded to ensures that it's sent via the path leading to <i>that</i> exact keyspace location. So someone would have to watch the <i>whole</i> network; all peers and all traffic between all peers, to see that you're inserting a message. That's NSA-level stuff. And if they can do that, then they can <i>instantly</i> trace who sent an "Anonymous" post too.</p>
<p>Someone watching the network would have to make a list of all cryptographic keys for all messages and all boards (generate KSKs for all messages on all boards they want to watch), then watch for those keys passing through their node, then decrypt them and read the content and look at the ID, and then constantly try to correlate what node is sending with that ID.</p>
<p>However, due to all the various routing techniques and timing delays in Freenet, they can't even prove if it came from your node or a node that's your peer. You'd literally need <i>all</i> of your peers to be law enforcement for them to prove that your node sent a message - and at that point, you're screwed no matter what you send.</p>
<p>Even if there <i>had</i> been any extra anonymity by posting as "Anonymous" (which there's isn't): I've seen Anonymous insert controversial files maybe once in recent memory. It never happens. They don't make use of even the imaginary extra anonymity.</p>
<p>The only <i>slight</i> downside to posting with an identity is that people can look for all of your posts. However, as the countless decade-long ID users have proven: As long as you don't give out personal details, it doesn't matter what name you use when you discuss things on Freenet.</p>
<h2># Easily resizing table columns.</h2>
<p>The column resizing behavior in Frost might seem weird to people who aren't used to Java applications. Unfortunately, Frost actually uses the <i>best</i> and most precise resizing method available in Java: Whenever you resize a column, it "borrows" the space from the next adjacent column (to the right of it). This mode ensures that all of your columns maintain their sizes perfectly, since it <i>only</i> affects the column you're resizing <i>and</i> the one to the right of it. All of the other Java resizing modes are pure hell, as they cause <i>all</i> columns to change size simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, the accurate "next column only" resizing mode used by Frost has <i>one</i> downside: If the next column (to the right) is a fixed-size column, then you won't be able to resize its adjacent column. The various "icon" columns are fixed-size. The workaround is pretty simple: Click on the fixed-size column's header and drag it to another location, then resize the column you wanted to resize, and then move the fixed-sized column back to its original location.</p>
<h2># Resetting all table columns without losing other settings.</h2>
<p>There is a quick way to reset the message/downloads/uploads table columns to their default widths and order without losing any of your other Frost settings. First close frost and open your "config/frost.ini" in a text editor, and then search for these settings (note the ".0" at the end of each name), and set their values to "-1" as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DownloadTable.tableindex.modelcolumn.0=-1</li>
  <li>UploadTable.tableindex.modelcolumn.0=-1</li>
  <li>MessageTreeTable.tableindex.modelcolumn.0=-1</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just save the file and start Frost-Next again. The existence of a value lower than 0 makes it ignore the old saved column order/sizes and return to the defaults.</p>
<h2># Raising memory limits if you're dealing with huge databases.</h2>
<p>This is for advanced users only. People with excessive database sizes with tens of thousands of messages per board can <i>slightly</i> improve performance by editing frost.bat (on Windows) or frost.sh (on Linux), and changing the "384" (MiB) RAM limit to something much larger. Next, edit "config/frost.ini" and look for all of the "perst.pagepoolsizeKiB" settings and raise the ones related to messages. Particularly "perst.pagepoolsizeKiB.messagecontents" which caches the contents of messages (and therefore speeds up searches a bit), and "perst.pagepoolsizeKiB.messages" which caches the actual messages subjects and metadata and speeds up re-visits to boards (since more of the metadata can be kept in memory if the cache is larger). Your sizes are in KiB, and must be multiples of 1024. So a value of "2048" means 2 MiB of RAM will be devoted to that database's cache, for instance. The default values are appropriate for almost all users, but people with insanely large boards may want to raise them.</p>
<h2># Archiving very old messages to speed up board loading.</h2>
<p>There is no reason <i>whatsoever</i> to have dead threads from years ago cluttering up your boards and slowing down the time it takes to open each board. To help you manage old messages, there's an archival feature in Frost. Go to "Preferences &gt; Expiration" and set the age (number of days) that a message must reach before being archived. Next, choose the desired behavior: You can either keep them in the main message database (this is the default and means that archiving is disabled), or you can archive old messages into a <i>separate</i> database, or delete them entirely.</p>
<p>You'll want to select "Archive expired messages by moving them to a separate database". This puts them in a separate database which means that they will <i>no longer</i> be visible when viewing the boards, <i>but</i> you can still <i>find</i> the messages by going into the Message Search's "Archive" tab and choosing what databases to search (by default it searches both the main and the archive databases). The search feature allows you to find old content when necessary, but to avoid having it slow down your boards.</p>
<p>Note that the cleanup process only runs during Frost's startup, and that it only runs every 5 days. You can use the "Force the database cleanup job to run during the next startup" to force a single cleanup to run ahead of the normal schedule.</p>
<p>Also be aware that the archival is irreversible, so be sure that you want to use it before enabling the feature.</p>
