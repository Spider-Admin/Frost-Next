Sub-windows like dialog boxes now center relative to the Frost window (although some re-use your last location, such as the search messages dialog; that way you can rely on it always re-appearing where you last closed it). Message boxes (information such as "your username is invalid") now open relative to the Frost window, instead of the old code which used to make them open between screens.</p>

    <p>Major improvement to all auto-sorting tables. The sent messages, unsent messages, search table, upload table, download table and <i>many</i> other places now use an advanced algorithm which <b>preserves</b> your item selection <i>while</i> the list is being dynamically re-sorted (meaning whenever table contents change due to rows being added/deleted/updated).</p>
    <p>What this means is that you can <i>finally</i> select files in your upload/download tables and <i>relax</i> and <i>trust</i> that the selections will be <i>preserved</i> even while the files re-sort themselves as they progress. The selection <i>used to</i> chaotically jump around and select random files (especially when sorted by Block count), which made it <i>absolutely impossible</i> to select in-progress files in the past.</p>
    <p>Now it <i>no longer matters</i> how chaotically the items are being re-sorted or how much they jump around; your selection remains rock solid and won't miss a single beat. You can even dynamically switch to sorting by another column at any time, and will see your row selections magically and accurately dance around to follow every movement.</p>

    <p>Improved the auto-scrolling in all tables. Most notably, the message list would scroll the desired item out of view if the scrolling was done backwards (upwards) from the current position. The new behavior is to nicely put the target item in the user's view, with a buffer of 3 other items below it (instead of being cramped towards the bottom of the window), while also ensuring that the item is always visible if the scrolling is done backwards.</p>

    <p>Completely rewrote the old, painfully awful "column sorting" code in <i>all</i> of Frost's tables. The old code was <i>ridiculously</i> bad and was <i>full</i> of severe bugs, which manifested itself as an inability to sort properly; i.e. trying to sort by the "Subject" column of the message list gave you a jumbled list of message which wasn't sorted at all. The "From" (sender) column gave you a case-sensitive list where "abc" and "ABC" were placed in completely different parts of the list. And <i>most</i> of Frost's sorting columns actually used plain "text comparison" for its sorting, which meant that things like sorting by the "Filesize" column was completely impossible, since a number like "100 KiB" was seen as <i>larger</i> than "5 MiB", for instance.</p>
    <p>The old code was completely thrown out, and the new system now has individually adapted, per-column sorting behaviors which reads the <i>exact</i> kind of data in that column and sorts it <i>appropriately</i> for the type of data. There are too many fixes to list them all, but to name but a few, timestamps are now always sorted according to time, filesizes are sorted according to size, and the "Subject" column of messages is sorted according to the case-insensitive subject while <i>ignoring</i> the "Re:" prefix (so that both the <i>initial</i> message of a thread <i>and</i> all of the "Re:" <i>replies</i> are sorted as a single group). Furthermore, the code now intelligently uses a <i>tie-breaking system</i> when sorting. For example, if you sort the message list it uses the Date as the tie-breaker; so if you sort the messages by Subject, it will first order all messages by their subject, and then those groups are further sub-sorted by the <i>date</i> of each message in that thread. This actually makes non-threaded mode almost as powerful as threaded mode, since you can now sort by Subject and read a "thread-like" view of each conversation. In case of file transfers, it uses the filename as the tie-breaker, which means that you can sort by things like progress and see a nicely sorted list of all items at each stage of progress. The new sorting code fixes about 40 different sorting-related bugs and finally makes the GUI behave as you'd wish it had done from day one.</p>

  <td class="cldesc"><div class="cldesc_enhanced">
    <p>Fixed a huge annoyance in all sortable tables: They used to keep the <i>previous</i> column's sort-direction (ascending/descending) whenever you clicked on <i>other</i> columns. So if you clicked on the date column to see the dates backwards and then clicked on Subject instead, all of the subjects were also ordered backwards. It now intelligently decides what to do, with a custom per-column behavior: Clicking on the same column multiple times toggles between ascending/descending, but clicking on a different column (than the one currently sorted) switches the order to <i>that</i> column's new default sort order.</p>
    <p>I've painstakingly gone through <i>every</i> column of <i>every</i> sortable table in Frost and set up default orders for each column, so that the first click is always the most logical order for that particular column (as an example, clicking the "Blocks" column shows the finished transfers first, and then the ones in progress, then the waiting ones, and so on...). Gone are the days of having to click a column multiple times to get the result you wanted!</p>

    <p>Keyboard shortcuts now react when you <i>let go</i> of the keyboard key as opposed to instantly when it's pressed down; this prevents a serious bug where pressing and holding down a key caused the action to be repeated about 10 times per second.

The workaround was to check for the Unity window manager (which is possible as of Ubuntu 11.10, from Oct 2011) and seeing if it claims exactly 24x24, in which case we scale the icon to 22x24 instead, so that it renders nicely.</p>
