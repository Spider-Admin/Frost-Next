<h1>Introduction (Frost-Next)</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to Help Index</a></p>
<h2># Why the name Frost-Next, and what is it?</h2>
<p>Because Frost-Next is to Frost what Freenet-Next was to Freenet. In Freenet-Next, they finally removed db4o and made Freenet stable, and we all rejoiced. In Frost-Next, world peace is achieved and we enter a new dawn of mankind, or something like that...</p>
<p>Well, it's actually quite simple: Because this isn't Frost. It's Frost-Next -- a complete rewrite of <i>all</i> critically important code and the introduction of <i>all</i> features and fixes that people have been dreaming about for over a decade. Hundreds of serious bugs have been squashed. Frost-Next is the result of nearly four months of incredibly hard, almost daily work.</p>
<p>The <i>old</i> Frost was such a mess that I had to spend 2 whole months <i>just</i> rewriting old code. Anytime I fixed 1 bug, I discovered 5 other serious bugs in the same old code, and that meant I had to constantly chase a ballooning TODO-list. Squash one rat, discover 5 more rats, rinse and repeat... My perfectionism didn't allow me to just ignore super serious bugs when I saw them, but taking care of them <i>all</i> was a <i>huge</i> task...</p>
<p>I certainly wish legacy Frost hadn't been written by total morons. Those are harsh words, but that's sadly a well known fact which has caused everyone to run away from touching the insanely bad code in the past. After spending months dealing with their garbage on a daily basis, I decided to stop coddling them and to tell the truth about their <i>insanely</i> awful code. An appropriate analogy for legacy Frost's source code is if you took a book, shredded it into confetti, and then super-glued it back together. And if Frost hadn't been a complete fucking mess, I could have saved 2 months of my life and a <i>lot</i> of energy. Furthermore, about 2-3 weeks were taken up by implementing a couple of very good but tedious community feature suggestions (mostly tedious because Frost's code is so insanely bad and convoluted that it's very hard to do non-trivial extensions). I wanted to be sure that people had a chance to get their dream-features into this rewrite, so that no further rewrites are ever needed again. That willingness to implement every good idea added a lot to the time...</p>
<p>It's been a really long road, and the <i>only</i> reason I kept going is that I didn't want to let anyone down after you've all become excited for a new release. You deserve a proper Frost replacement after 15 years of suffering the original garbage.</p>
<p>The worst part was that I couldn't have just released the work-in-progress code and let someone else finish it, since nobody else could have picked it up. Sadly that isn't hyperbole, since all of the original developers and other people over the years (like SnowFlake) have just added more and more <i>bugs</i> whenever they tried to code... they're the whole <i>reason</i> I had to spend half of the development time (2 months) <i>fixing</i> old code instead of being able to spend that time <i>adding</i> features.</p>
<p>It was pure hell to work through the extremely sloppy, legacy Frost code day in and day out. If the community had any competent Java coders I would have released the work-in-progress source code long ago and let them finish it. Instead, I decided to push through <i>hell</i> for all of you, and finished <i>literally everything</i>: 259 changed and added source code files, ~60,000 lines of code, <i>two hundred and eighty-six</i> serious bug fixes and enhancements, and a <i>lot</i> of new features. And <i>that</i> change-count only tells half the picture, since <i>many</i> changes and new features consisted of 2-10 sub-features that <i>aren't individually listed</i> in the changelog -- the real change count tracked during development was actually around 500 changes. Whew!</p>
<p>Development was done with a dev-version and a stable version running side by side. The stable version is what I was using to communicate daily on the "frost" board, and the dev-version was the one getting rapid changes. Every few days (after enough related changes had been finished), I compiled a new "stable" from the dev-version and switched to using that as my main Frost client. So every change and feature has been thoroughly tested <i>both</i> during the dev-version development, <i>and</i> when the features were moved over to "stable" (where every change has been <i>thoroughly</i> used live for a month and a half).</p>
<p>If any bugs remain, it'll <i>only</i> be some <i>very minor</i> stuff hidden in Frost's old core, but I've taken care of <i>every</i> bug found during code <i>review</i>, during regular <i>usage</i> of Frost, and during the major <i>rewrites</i> of all legacy source files. This is the healthiest that Frost's code has <i>ever</i> been.</p>
<p>The best feeling in a long time was when I packed up the final, release-ready code. The version you're now holding in your hands.</p>
<p>Enjoy the next generation!</p>

<h2># What happened to the old, legacy Frost?</h2>
<p>Their last official update was half a decade ago (in Q1 2011). All of the original developers have left - and good riddance at that, since all they left behind was a huge mess that I've had to spend four months fixing. They still have a symbolic volunteer maintainer from Spain, but he has shown that he's just as bad as the rest of them at coding. There is nothing "official" about the old Frost repo. It's just another fork at this point. Legacy Frost is dead and they've thankfully taken their constant introduction of serious bugs to the grave at last. If they some day decide to try to copy code from Next, then why trust someone who just copies and then starts adding their typical bugs to the code as usual? They're welcome to use parts of Next, of course, but I've had to work through <i>their</i> messy, buggy garbage code on a daily basis for nearly four months, and I don't trust their abilities whatsoever. Luckily, Next is a <i>feature-complete</i> and <i>finished</i> product that you can now enjoy for as long as Freenet lives.</p>
<h2># What about Sadao's and SnowFlake's patches?</h2>
<p>Frost-Next contains rewritten, bugfixed and extended versions of <i>all</i> good ideas from Sadao's and SnowFlake's patches. Sadao did mostly tiny one-liner changes, which made sense and were mostly good. In the case of SnowFlake, he attempted larger changes but his code was so insanely <i>awful</i> that 50% of it had to be completely thrown out and the remaining 50% had to be totally rewritten to fix his incredibly serious bugs (broken message search, inability to download messages from days in the past and instead downloading messages from the year 1342, and countless more; search for his name in the list of changes). All you need to know is that Next contains fixed, rewritten and enhanced versions of <i>every</i> good idea from both legacy Frost and the Sadao and SnowFlake's versions, so that you <i>never</i> need any other version of Frost <i>ever</i> again.</p>
<h2># What is the Next version number?</h2>
<p>Frost-Next has no version number. It's "Frost-Next"; 4 months of extremely hard work fixing <i>everything</i> that was wrong with Frost and adding everything that people have been dreaming of for a decade. Anyone who touches the source after this should be viewed with suspicion. It does not need <i>anything</i> else, and there are a <i>lot</i> of fuckups in the past who have consistently produced buggy code that lead to Next being necessary. Their <i>incompetence</i> is the <i>whole reason</i> that Next exists. Without their incompetence, there would be no Next, so I guess we can thank them for that.</p>
<p>Then there's the fact that law enforcement can compromise famous ID-users, which is why I made the FNAutoPatch tool so that we never have to risk using oo, moony or mmaalfdks Freenet patches again (and those guys are my friends and fellow developers). Likewise, the source code for Frost-Next is available. If everyone knew how to compile, I would <i>only</i> release it as source-code. I hate precompiled binaries (whether they're patched Freenet versions or precompiled Frost). They're a perfect chance for law enforcement to bust people.</p>
<p>I do not want trust as The Kitty. I want to be known for contributions, not for some magical auto-trust just because of my name. That is why there is <i>one</i> version of Frost-Next. All of the internal code is written to stay future-compatible forever, and anyone can run Next in a VM with a packet-capture program to see that it isn't contacting any external IPs. It only talks to the local Freenet node IP. It's totally clean. People should be able to learn and trust <i>one</i> program and <i>never</i> have to worry about me constantly releasing new versions that may be LEA-infested one day.</p>
<p>Instead, I spent four months making sure that <i>everything</i> was taken care of as <i>one</i> awesome release. The sheer amount of work and changes in Next represents about 50-100 "version releases" of normal software, but it was all packaged into <i>one</i> release for <i>your safety</i>. Anyone who claims to be me or claims to have improved Frost-Next in the future should be ignored or at least viewed <i>very</i> suspiciously, since you never know what their agenda is.</p>
<p>The same goes for me. I've given you Frost-Next, which is an improvement to Frost of the same <i>immense</i> magnitude and importance as when Freenet-Next came out, and it is now up to you to take your time to validate the binaries and code so that you know that Next can be trusted. It doesn't matter that I've been in the community for years. It doesn't matter what kind of material I've posted in the past. All that matters is that this is brand new code which needs to be validated. Thanks to Next being <i>one</i> awesome version, you only have to do that work <i>once</i>, and then you can refer future users to this <i>single</i>, trusted release.</p>
<p>I <i>vouch</i> for the fact that Next is completely clean. I've worked myself into oblivion to give you Next, and have taken <i>every</i> necessary step to keep you safe. Explore the new help system and check out the <i>countless</i> serious bug fixes, enhancements and new features. Have fun and kick ass out there with the Next generation! ;-) Enjoy!</p>
