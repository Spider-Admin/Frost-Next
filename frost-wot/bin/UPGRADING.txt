To upgrade from one of the old versions of Frost (legacy, Sadao and/or SnowFlake),
you need to carefully follow this *exact* procedure.

This upgrade must be done by *only* copying your old database into Next; otherwise
you risk creating a bad mix of old and new code which won't work properly!

Also note that Frost-Next will upgrade your frost.ini and databases to a new format,
which means that you *cannot* downgrade after you've started Next. (You must back
up your *whole* old Frost folder if you want the ability to downgrade to it later.)



# Step 1:
Make sure that your *old* Frost and Frost-Next are *both* CLOSED DOWN.


# Step 2:
Unpack "Frost-Next.zip" to a *new* folder. Do NOT put it in your old Frost folder (yet).


# Step 3:
Move/Copy these *exact* files from your *old* Frost to your new Frost-Next folder,
and remember to overwrite all conflicting files and folders:

- config/boards.xml (file): Your list of currently subscribed boards. Important!
- config/frost.ini (file): Your main application configuration. Important!
- downloads (folder): Only move if you want to move your previously finished downloads.
- store (folder): Contains the databases (messages, queued files, etc). Important!

This is the full list. Do NOT move/copy ANYTHING else from the old Frost folder.
Most importantly, do NOT copy "the whole config folder", since you would overwrite
some new files from Frost-Next. You must carefully follow the instructions above!


# Step 4:
You can now place your finished Frost-Next folder anywhere you want it.

Tip: I suggest using the same path and folder name as your old Frost installation,
so that Frost-Next will be able to relativize (simplify) your previous list of
download-folders from unwieldy, absolute paths to ones that are relative to the
Frost folder. After the first launch (when the path relativization takes place),
you can then simply shut down Next and rename its folder to "frost-next" again.


# Step 5:
Start Frost-Next via frost.bat (Windows) or frost.sh (Linux/Mac).
All of your previous data will be migrated and upgraded on the first launch.

Enjoy!
