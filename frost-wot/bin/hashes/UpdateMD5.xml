             Where to save your previous hash file before starting a new
             scan. A backup will only happen if your current file (above)
             exists and is non-empty.

             Note that backups aren't really necessary, since the hasher
             will save all current work if you terminate it ahead of time
             (such as via the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut on most systems).
             In fact, it's completely safe to use Ctrl+C to abort the current
             hashing job (and save the current progress). You can then simply
             start the process again to resume the hashing job later!

             If you want to disable backups completely, you can provide
             the value "none" instead of a filename here.

             If multiple backups are enabled, each backup will be saved
             as "{BackupFile}.currenttime".

             This option removes all missing files from your .md5 file
             after completing a scan. Useful if you don't want deleted
             files to be blocked by Frost-Next. Although you could simply
             disable the MD5 hash blocking temporarily in Next instead.

             You do NOT have to use this option if you *just* worry about
             "dupes" in your .md5 file from moved files. If we detect the
             same hash as something that already exists in your .md5 file,
             we ALWAYS compare the filenames of all files with the same
             name and hash (such as "/abc/example.mp4" vs "/xyz/example.mp4"),
             and if the hash and basic filename ("example.mp4") matches,
             *AND* the old file is missing from your hard disk, then we
             will assume that the file has been moved, and will delete
             the old entry from your .md5 file automatically.

             Before starting a new scan, this option will remove all excluded
             files from your current .md5. Excluded files are paths that don't
             belong in your list of "include" paths, *or* that exist in your
             list of "exclude" paths. It is recommended to leave this option
             on, so that your changes to the include/exclude lists are applied
             to all of your previous hashes.

             Sets the minimum filesize to be hashed, in megabytes (MiB).
             Can be fractional, such as "0.5".
             If you try to set this to 0, we hash *all* non-empty (>= 1 byte) files.

             However, be warned: Freenet *itself* doesn't contain any MD5 hashes for
             files that are smaller than 1 MiB, so there's ZERO point in setting this
             value lower than 1 MiB (if you *just* want to use these hashes for Freenet
             anti-dupe checking). The option to go lower is *only* provided for people
             who may want to use the MD5s from this hasher for non-Freenet purposes.

             are being entered, why certain files in those directories are skipped, etc.
             Could be helpful for debugging your patterns, but should be disabled
             in normal cases for faster scanning (printing debug to terminal is slow!).

        <!--
             File extension patterns to hash. You should leave this at the
             defaults to only hash archive and video formats. There is ZERO
             point in hashing individual images, since they don't get uploaded
             enough on Freenet to matter. You'll just grow your MD5 file and
             slow down hashing for no reason at all.
             Note that you can create unlimited groups of patterns by following
             the same formats at the predefined groups below.
             If you want to disable certain patterns, then just comment out
             their lines as shown in this default set which has disabled
             all of the audio, documents, executables and images patterns.
             The file extension patterns are case-insensitive.
             Also note that any "#" in the pattern means "any number",
             so "R##" means files ending in r00 to r99 (which is used for
             many common multipart RAR files).

             Non-existent paths will be ignored during scanning.

             Type can be either "include" (scan this path and all subfolders),
             or "exclude" (exclude this path and all subfolders).
             Paths to exclude must obviously be sub-paths of included paths.

             You are allowed to specify both files and folders here. So you can
             choose to exclude (or include) specific files. Filename wildcards are
             not supported, however. This ability to target files is just a small bonus.

             All encountered filesystem symlinks will be followed on Linux/Unix/Mac.

             A few example paths have been commented out, for you to base yours on.

             For those unfamiliar with HTML and XML:
               "Commented out" means lines that have been surrounded by "<!- ->",
               and it means that those example lines are completely de-activated.
               Your own lines must NOT be surrounded by any "<!- ->" comment
               indicators, or they'll be completely *IGNORED* too!
               Have a look around the rest of this configuration file, and you'll
               hopefully see the clear difference in appearance between comments
               and active options. If you still need help, ask a technical friend.

             That's all! Have fun and enjoy!
